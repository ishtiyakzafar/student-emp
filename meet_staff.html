            <h1>Founder & Director: Latoya</h1>
            <p>
              Latoya wasn't born with privilege, but with worn sneakers and a
              fierce spirit. Basketball became her escape, a court her
              community. Witnessing health struggles in her adulthood, she knew
              action was needed. Bootstrapping her passion, Latoya created LT
              Fitness, a non-profit pulsing with fitness classes and laughter.
              Not a CEO, but a coach in sneakers, Latoya led by example,
              understanding well-being wasn't a luxury, but a tapestry woven
              from movement, education, and community. Today, LT Fitness
              thrives, a testament to Latoya's belief that everyone deserves a
              healthy life, proving change sometimes starts with worn sneakers
              and a fierce spirit.

              passion goes beyond scheduling. Beyond coordination, he champions
